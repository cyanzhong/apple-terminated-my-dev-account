# What happened

Exactly a week ago, my developer account was terminated by Apple.

I shared this incident along with my story on GitHub and Hacker News, it could be found here: https://github.com/cyanzhong/apple-terminated-my-dev-account/blob/master/README.md

After that, I discussed with some of my indie developer friends, and tried my best to reach out to some Apple employees.

My story was widely propagated, I received a message from an Apple employee, I was told that my dev account has been re-enabled.

Thanks, everyone who helped me in exploring this, it is so hard to change Apple's decision. Thank you!

# Account issues

I was able to log in my account a few hours after the "re-enabled" message, that gave me confidence about it, my apps couldn't be found on the App Store though.

In the next few days, my account was in an abnormal state that I have never seen. For instance, "Sales and Trends" shows me "Your account is pending", Apps are "Pending Agreement" (well, I couldn't find an agreement).

A few days later, Apple called me to solve my account issue, I managed to sign the "agreement" and send my apps back to the App Store.

So, I confirmed that my developer account is back.

# Why was my account terminated

Unfortunately, Apple didn't tell me the exact reason (as you can expect). But I am afraid that it's related to some "irregular activity" connected to my account, let me tell you some background about it.

I have an app called [JSBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1312014438), it is well known in my country, and it's widely shared as pirate copies. I don't expect people outside China can understand this: many people are using shared Apple IDs.

There are many "account providers", they purchase paid apps, share the Apple ID and password to everyone, so developers only get paid once. In China, even some well-known companies are doing this (e.g. PP 助手 which is part of the Alibaba Inc). It's dangerous and illegal, I just want to point out this phenomenon without complaining too much.

A few months ago, I detected many shared accounts, and blocked them, this action introduced a new issue to me: abuse of refund.

You may already know, applying a refund is really easy for users, but it's a pain for developers. So, many people purchased my app, and applied refund immediately (without uninstalling my app, of course). It even blocked my payments, as I shared before: https://twitter.com/cyanapps/status/1148429663376535552

Again, I don't think people outside China can understand this, it's so absurd.

From Apple's perspective, I think it makes sense that they misunderstood those activities. Maybe they are training their rules for blocking malicious behavior on the App Store, such as fake ratings, and ranking (it's another long story in China), and my account was terminated mistakenly. That's my guess, I wasn't given any explanation.

# Conclusion

The past week has been unforgettable for me, apparently.

As a developer, we must fight against pirated software, that won't change, but it hurts when some irregular activity happens and Apple couldn't identify it correctly.

Also, I really hope that Apple can pay more attention to developer relationship, especially for indie developers, they don't have many resources to reach out Apple. No matter what happened, we can talk.

Thanks, have a great weekend!
